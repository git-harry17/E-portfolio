## Gesture Based Volume Control
I recently created a hand tracking module using OpenCV and Mediapipe, which enables real-time hand gesture recognition through a webcam. Building on this module, I developed a gesture-based volume controller that allows you to adjust the system volume using simple hand gestures!

## 🔍 How It Works:
The hand tracking module processes frames from the webcam and detects hand landmarks using Mediapipe's Hand solution.
The landmarks are used to calculate the distance between the thumb and index finger.
This distance is then mapped to the system volume range.
When the distance changes, the system volume adjusts accordingly, giving you seamless, touch-free control over your computer's audio
## 🧠 Technical Highlights:
✅ Built with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe
✅ Real-time hand detection and landmark tracking
✅ Gesture recognition based on landmark positions
✅ Smooth volume control using the calculated distance between thumb and index finger

## 🎯 Why This Project Is Cool:
✔️ No need for physical contact – perfect for touchless control
✔️ Fast and accurate hand tracking using Mediapipe
✔️ Enhances user experience with intuitive gesture-based interaction
